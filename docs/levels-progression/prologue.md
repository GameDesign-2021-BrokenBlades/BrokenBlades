# Prologue

## Story Connection

The main character wakes up at the aftermath of a bloody battle. He is stripped
of his weapons and armor and only left with his pointy ottoman helmet in
addition to his light chainmail kilt and boots. He is disoriented and unsure of
what had happened to him. After looking down, he realizes that he has three huge
bleeding cuts across his chest and down his torso. The pain is slowing him down.
He is continuously asking himself questions as he's walking through the
battlefield occasionally saying things like:
"What the hell happened?"
"This pain is unbearable"
"How did we lose?"
"Those damn bastards!"
Suddenly, he stumbles on four long spikes impaling is comrades heads while their
bodies are still connected. A truly gruesome and bloody scene. He stands there
for a moment speechless.
"I'll find whoever did this"

## Progression

The main character begins his journey of revenge for his fallen
comrades. He walks through the ravaged battlefield in search of answers and
painfully struggles to pick up an ottoman sword stuck to the ground (forced
action).
Since the character is injured, an almost empty health bar is shown and a
depleted stamina bar is there. The player can't run. This level will
not require the player to jump
and instead will only allow him to crouch **optional**.
Through every new mechanic, a text is needed for a basic tutorial.

**THIS IS WORK IN PROGRESS**

## Setting

The battle scene has swords and arrows stuck in the ground (player can't
pickup). Dead bodies in the background and maybe human remains, skeletons,
skulls, dead horses. Rubble is also there that prompts the player to climb over
it or crouch under it. Flags are also waving in the back while being stuck to
the ground. Occasional burring trees in the background.

## Significant Needed Assets

- The battlefield background with
  - dead bodies
  - arrows and swords on the ground
  - rubble
  - trees, (intact and burning)
- Spikes with dead bodies
- blood puddles under the bodies
